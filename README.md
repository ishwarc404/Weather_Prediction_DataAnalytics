#Run
1. Make sure pandas and request libraries are installed.
2. Run scraping.py in /DATA SCRAPING to scrape txt data and make individual csvs for each buoy (generated in /DATA SCRAPING/final_csv)
3. The PRE_PROCESSING AND EDA folder has one jupyter notebook with all the visualisations and inferences. Clean csvs are generated in /clean_csvs after running the entire notebook.
4. The MODEL folder has all three other folders- Logistic, Naive Bayes And OTHER ATTEMPTS.
5. First two folders have one one jupyter notebook each which can be simply run to get the output.
6. /OTHER ATTEMPTS has some jupyter notebooks which has codes of our other attempts to acheive desirable results. (not a part of the main project)

#note : for now we have to scrape 1 by 1 or else length error
