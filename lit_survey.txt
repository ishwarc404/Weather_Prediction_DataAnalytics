#Litrature Survey for the project - Weather Prediction

Objective : Trying to predict the occurance/formation of a hurricane over the seas using both recent and historical data obtained
from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration webpages. 
NOAA stores and manages a very extensively detailed database of all the buoy data.
A buoy is a floating device that can have many purposes.Sea buoys very frequently measure various 


Problem Statement: Trying to predict the occurance/formation of a hurricane over the seas using both recent and historical data obtained
from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's sea buoy data.

Data: Data for our project consists of historical and realtime buoy data which is available on the NOAA's website seperately for each
buoy. We are currently foccusing on the hurricane "Irene". Hence we have a list of all the buoys which were in the trajectory of this
particular hurricane. Using the historical data of 2011, we want to develop a model, which predicts the occurance of an hurricane.

4. Introduction to the context of the problem (why is it important?)
Hurricanes are one of the must destructive natural calamities. Category 5 hurricanes have costed thousands of human lives and upto
a maximum of 125 billion dollers in property loss. Many of the goverment operated hurricane management centres like THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER
and the CENTRAL PACIFIC HURRICANE CENTER give an accurate prediction about the formation and the trajectory of the hurricanes using satellite imaging
upto 48 hours before. In most of the cases 2-5 days aren't enough for entire cities to prepare themselves for a hurricane. This is why
an early and accurate prediction of such calamities is very important.


6. Proposed problem statement with the specific issue you intend to address
Trying to predict the occurance/formation of a hurricane over the seas using both recent and historical data obtained
from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's sea buoy data atleast 7-10 days in advance. Forcasting right and 
forcasting early will be the goal as time is a very crucial factor which plays a vital role while taking appropriate 
preventive measures.
