#Litrature Survey for the project - Weather Prediction

Objective : Trying to predict the occurance/formation of a hurricane over the seas using both recent and historical data obtained
from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration webpages. 
NOAA stores and manages a very extensively detailed database of all the buoy data.
A buoy is a floating device that can have many purposes.Sea buoys very frequently measure various 


Problem Statement: Trying to predict the occurance/formation of a hurricane over the seas using both recent and historical data obtained
from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's sea buoy data.

Data: Data for our project consists of historical and realtime buoy data which is available on the NOAA's website seperately for each
buoy. We are currently foccusing on the hurricane "Irene". Hence we have a list of all the buoys which were in the trajectory of this
particular hurricane. Using the historical data of 2011, we want to develop a model, which predicts the occurance of an hurricane.

4. Introduction to the context of the problem (why is it important?)
Hurricanes are one of the must destructive natural calamities. Category 5 hurricanes have costed thousands of human lives and upto
a maximum of 125 billion dollers in property loss. Many of the goverment operated hurricane management centres like THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER
and the CENTRAL PACIFIC HURRICANE CENTER give an accurate prediction about the formation and the trajectory of the hurricanes using satellite imaging
upto 48 hours before. In most of the cases 2-5 days aren't enough for entire cities to prepare themselves for a hurricane. This is why
an early and accurate prediction of such calamities is very important.


6. Proposed problem statement with the specific issue you intend to address
Trying to predict the occurance/formation of a hurricane over the seas using both recent and historical data obtained
from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's sea buoy data atleast 7-10 days in advance. Forcasting right and 
forcasting early will be the goal as time is a very crucial factor which plays a vital role while taking appropriate 
preventive measures.

Hurricane forecasts have traditionally focused on predicting a storm’s track and intensity. 
The track and size of the storm determine which areas may be hit. 
To do so, forecasters use models – essentially software programs, often run on large computers.
Unfortunately, no single forecast model is consistently better than other models at making these predictions. 
Sometimes these forecasts show dramatically different paths, diverging by hundreds of miles. Other times, 
the models are in close agreement. In some cases, even when models are in close agreement, the small differences in track have very 
large differences in storm surge, winds and other factors that impact damage and evacuations.

So, forecasters use a collection of models to determine a likely range of tracks and intensities. 

Such models include the NOAA’s Global Forecast System and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts global models.
The FSU Superensemble was developed by a group at our university, led by meteorologist T.N. Krishnamurti, in the early 2000s. 
The Superensemble combines output from a collection of models, giving more weight to the models that showed better predicted past 
weather events, such as Atlantic tropical cyclone events.


limitations:
Over the past decade, track forecasts have steadily improved. 
A plethora of observations – from satellites, buoys and aircraft flown into the developing storm – allow scientists to better 
understand the environment around a storm, and in turn improve their models. Some models have improved by as much as 40 percent 
for some storms.
However, it’s extremely difficult for a model to estimate the maximum wind speed of a tropical cyclone at any given future time. 
Models are inexact in their descriptions of the entire state of the atmosphere and ocean at the start time of the model. 
Small-scale features of tropical cyclones – like sharp gradients in rainfall, surface winds and wave heights within and outside 
of the tropical cyclones – are not as reliably captured in the forecast models.

What are the problems with the current hurricane predictions?
Ref: http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2010/teams/neworleans1/predicting%20hurricanes.htm
There have been great strides forward made in the science of forecasting hurricanes, 
but there is still a lot to do.  One major problem is accuracy.  The National Hurricane Center has been forecasting 
the paths of hurricanes since the early 1950’s.  They issue 120 hour, 96 hour, 72 hour, 48 hour, 24 hour, and 12 hour forecasts.  
(The 120 hour and 96 hour forecasts were introduced in 2003.)  The error decreases as the time before landfall decreases.  
The error has also decreased over the years as models become more accurate (NOAA, 2004).  Despite becoming more accurate, 
the error is still relatively large.
